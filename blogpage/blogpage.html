    <div>A CRITIQUE ON COLLEGE</div><br>
    <div> June 3, 2021</div><br>
    <p>
      I am a college dropout, but not because I was a half-wit who partied and smoked weed all day (just some days). I held a 3.7GPA for Mechanical Engineering at Penn State and a 3.9GPA at my local community college. Despite this, I am probably never going to finish my major because I truly believe that college has now become a cash cow for the government, that the advent of new technologies such as the internet will one day make colleges obsolete, and that college is where you learn impractical theories and pseudo-intelligent buzzwords so you can impress your employers and get your foot in the metaphorical door, but no further than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I start addressing my first point, I must make a disclaimer that I absolutely support the pursuit of knowledge, and the discipline of maintaining intellectual integrity by consistently studying something that can be of benefit to society, and a person who is constantly driven to understand more of the world, possessing a college degree or not, is a person I respect. What I do not respect however are the education system implicitly implying how college is a mandatory step to progress in society, instilling fear in the weak-minded and lost by proclaiming that without a degree, you are doomed to a penniless and worthless life, on par with street thugs and con men, when in reality they are the real con men. Another reason why I dropped out is the fact that I have to take a bunch of irrelevant courses which objectively serves no practical purpose other than to extract more money from my wallet, because let’s face it, courses like geography or chicano/phillipino/martian studies (I can’t wait to be cancelled for racism) are only around because college deems it necessary to graduate, because no one would take it out of interest, just for easy credits. College is a profit-driven industry and not an educational experience, and few can make that distinction, and the rest can’t be bothered to because they see college as a big cocaine-fueled party that their parents will pay for anyways. Finally, the reason why degree holders “earn” more than non-degree holders is an absolute myth if you are capable of basic arithmetic. A Ivy League graduate doesn’t earn more money than one from a community college because they’ve learned more, (because I can’t image how boolean functions could be fundamentally better from one institution to another) it’s really because they’ve invested more money into it and thus got a higher return, so it really confirms my point that college is like a big investment portfolio that you put money in and the more you put in, the higher you get back, but like an investment portfolio, college is not meant to educate.

    <p id="imgcomment">"so before we hire you for the full stack developer position, can you tell me why Costa Rica is suffering from desertification, or the history of Philipino Christianity?"
    <p>
      With access to remote communication technologies like zoom, now a person can talk, text, and even see on screen what their instructor is doing in high quality (unless you got crappy internet) without having to deal with sitting in California traffic, paying for parking, walking your overheated ass to class then sit in the back because all the front seats were taken, then get paired up with some clown that wears Gucci flip flops and hits juuls every single day (because if you could afford overpriced footwear, surely you or your parents can afford to send you to a real university?). As a genuine introvert, meaning someone who doesn’t tattoo their Meyers-Briggs personality type on their wrist, I value my time away from as many stinky humans as possible. Furthermore, not everyone learns optimally in a college setting, meaning next to a table in a room listening to someone lecture. I am a visual learner, so I learn best when I see what’s happening visually on a computer screen, not much when someone is talking about it (for computer science specifically, all content is learned visually, because when we can speak plain English to a computer and have it understand and process it as a function, I will stand corrected).
      </p>

      <p>
      College, as I’ve hammered down in my first paragraph, is not to teach you fundamental and practical skills, because if they actually taught you something useful, you could easily become better than your instructors and take their jobs, and they wouldn’t want that. Of course, it’s not a complete waste of time and money, sometimes you wrap your head around a cool concept (that you can also get for free at home) and you can brag about it to your employers and friends and they’ll hail you as the next Steve Jobs. For me, I want to be admired like Linus Torvalds, because like Linux, education should be free and open-source. But of course, such a profitable industry in a free market capitalist society is not going away without a fight, with increasing advertisements centered around nauseating buzzwords like “family-culture”, “revolutionary” and “cutting-edge” and “increasing demands for graduates”, most people who can’t seem to see the obvious scam fall prey to these “top in-demand schools” that basically teaches stuff copied from Stack Overflow. At least now you have a piece of paper that proves you have paid to win (in gaming culture) and now an employer will hire you. But of course, you will spend most of your time googling for codes, just like an non-degree holding programmer, because surprise: human beings are not computers capable of remembering everything they’ve learned. Difference between you and me is that you’re a couple (hundred?) thousand grands in debt, while I have created actual projects that can be of immediate use.
    </p>
      <p>
        But why do so many FAANG wannabe companies demand a 4 year degree in order to even work there? I’ll tell you the truth, and it’s not because of the skills they earned during their tenure at university, (because a computer science degree is literally deprecated as you as you get it, due to how fast programming evolves) but rather it’s because they know you are more likely to stay at their company and willing to do whatever they say because they know you're in massive debt, and you can’t afford to lose a job. They don’t have the same level of control over me, because I can afford to lose that job to run to a better one, which is why most employers see me as a risk, a jobhopper, even if I have the same level or more skill than another degree holding programmer.

    <p id="imgcomment">an actual linkedIn post, but perhaps he was interviewing for candidates for a child care center, because that's the only reason why family relations would be considered as a factor. Regardless, I wouldn't work here for a million dollars.</p>
    <p>
      College is going to be obsolete in next decade or two, that’s why it’s pulling stunts like offering scholarships for people that gets vaccinated (fun fact: you’re not getting vaccinated, they’re just pumping you full of random chemicals and see which one kills COVID and which one doesn’t; you’re basically a guinea pig). I urge people to think for themselves, and if they can’t, at least keep your mouth shut instead of spewing misinformed garbage. Thank you for reading my rant.
